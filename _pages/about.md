This website is still under construction. I am a PhD student at Bonn Graduate School of Economics ([BGSE](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en)), University of Bonn.

My research interest is in Macroeconomics. I try to find new Macro-relevant questions and answer to them empirically both with Macro and Micro level data. Dominant themes in my work are inflation, asset returns and inequality.
