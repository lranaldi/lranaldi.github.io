This website is still under construction. I am a PhD student at Bonn Graduate School of Economics ([BGSE](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en)), University of Bonn.

My research interest is in Macroeconomics and Macro-finance. I try to find new Macro-relevant questions and answer to them empirically, both with macro and micro level data, often newly digitized from historical sources. A dominant theme in my work is inflation and its causes and consequences within the macro-financial system.
